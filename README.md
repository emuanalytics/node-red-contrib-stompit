# Stomp In/Out Nodes for Node-RED

This package provides an alternative to the standard Node-RED stomp in/out nodes. It is designed as a drop-in replacement for the official nodes.

The [stompit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stompit) client library is used internally. This adds support for the STOMP v1.2 protocol.
